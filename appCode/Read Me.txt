This 'Emerald Thumb' folder can be placed in the 'AndroidStudioProjects' directory as a new project

If you just want to try the app, I included a debug build apk which I tested on my Android phone

The app was built and tested using the Pixel 2 API 26 environment in Android Studio. I used the 
Amplify CLI to configure my AWS account information, which is saved to the configuration json files. 

These files can also be configured manually by replacing the values I have with those of another 
AWS account. This will mainly include updating the stored Cognito credentials.

	To configure with Amplify, first install the CLI, then user the 'amplify configure', 
	'amplify add auth', and 'amplify add storage'

	Each has on-screen instructions on what info it needs to continue, I used default settings
	for everything

	End with 'amplify push' to publish your changes to the cloud. The environment is now set up

I included a folder of the primary files I worked with to create the app
